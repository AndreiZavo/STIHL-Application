## General info
 This application is meant to speed up and to render the managment of a great deal of clients. 
 The user can find in a matter of seconds a client's information not just due to the sorting feature and filter options, but can also scan his designeted barcode and his credentials wil appear instantly.
 I construct it entirely with Python and at the user interface level I used Qt framework which I connected afterwords with Python.
