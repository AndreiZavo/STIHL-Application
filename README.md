## General info
 This application is meant to speed up and to render the managment of a great deal of clients. 
 The user can find in a matter of seconds a client's information not just due to the sorting feature and filter options, but can also scan his designeted barcode and his credentials will appear instantly. 
 Moreover, when a new client is beeing added to the database, he will receive a voucher in the form of a PDF on which he has his unique barcode.
 I construct it entirely with Python and at the user interface level I used Qt framework which I connected afterwords with Python.
